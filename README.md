# Conditional_Monitoring_Hydraulic_system

The dataset represents the results obtained with hydraulic test ring. The test rig consists of a primary working and a secondary cooling-filtration circuit which are connected via the oil tank. The system has various input variables which are mainly processed for every 60 seconds. The input variables includes various temperature sensors, pressure sensors, volume flow sensors. On the other hand, different hydrauic components such as cooler, valve, pump and accumulator are quatitively varied.
